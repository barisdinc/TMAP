# The Microwave Antenna project

This github project will include all details of my new microave antenna setup which will be palced on my backyard.
These are the initial targets for this project :
- Build a solid concrete base for the 3m dish antenna
- Try to modify the antenna for a bigger antenna with a proper F/D ratio using known sources and calculations
- Place an azimuth and elevation rotator which will be controlled by an on site computer (preferably an rasPi running linux) for running with self intelligence
- Build septum feeds for proper bands (e.g. 1296MHz, 2400MHz, 5700MHz, 10GHz, and so on)
- Build a site cabinet to include all loss sensitive equipment (e.g.: receivers, preamplifiers, amplifiers, excites, etc.)
- SDR Receiver integration and GPSDO
- Transverter applications
- Signal collection methodology
- Signal Analysis methodology
- 


note: I will try to photograph and explain al steps in details
